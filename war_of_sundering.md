# The War of Sundering: When Reality Nearly Broke

*Approximately 2,000 years before present*

## The Conflict

### The Three Claims
The war began over the **Heart of the Mountain** - a massive crystalline formation deep beneath the Sword Mountains that was simultaneously:
- **To the Dwarves**: The first forge of Moradin, where he shaped the prime material plane
- **To the Elves**: A fallen star containing the tears of Corellon, holding memories of the world's creation
- **To the Dragons**: An egg of Io, the progenitor of all dragonkind, waiting to hatch the "Final Dragon"

### The Participants
- **The Delzoun Empire**: Led by **High King Thorgrim the Unyielding**
- **The Elven Courts of Illefarn**: Under **Queen Sylaestra Moonwhisper**
- **The Dragon Conclaves**: Metallic and Chromatic dragons united under **Keraunorax the Gold** and **Syzygax the Red**
- **The Forgotten Fourth**: The **Illithid Colony of the Deepest Dark**, secretly manipulating all sides

### The Escalation
What began as legal disputes and border skirmishes escalated when each race began using the Heart's power:
- Dwarves forged **Voidsteel Weapons** that could cut through the fabric of reality
- Elves wove **Temporal Enchantments** that aged enemies to dust or reversed their existence
- Dragons breathed **Unmaking Fire** that didn't just destroy—it erased things from ever having existed

## The Catastrophic Energies Unleashed

### The Sundering Effect
As the three armies clashed at the Heart, their reality-warping weapons created **The Sundering**—a cascading failure of natural law:
- **Temporal Storms**: Past, present, and future collided. Warriors found themselves fighting their ancestors and descendants simultaneously
- **Spatial Fractures**: Geography became fluid. Mountains walked, valleys inverted, and distance became meaningless
- **Existential Echoes**: Killed warriors didn't simply die—they flickered between states of being, creating undead-living hybrids
- **Planar Bleeds**: The boundaries between planes weakened. Demons, celestials, and far realm entities poured through

### The Mind Plague
The Illithids' psychic manipulations backfired catastrophically, creating a **Collective Madness**:
- Thoughts became contagious, spreading like disease
- Memories merged between individuals, creating false histories
- The distinction between self and other began dissolving

### The Dragon's Paradox
When Syzygax tried to claim the Heart alone, the conflicting mythologies caused a paradoxical reaction:
- The Heart began simultaneously being a forge, a star-tear, and a dragon egg
- Reality couldn't reconcile these truths, causing cascading logical failures
- The laws of cause and effect started breaking down

## The Prophet's Arrival

### Serenity Truthweaver
A humble human shepherd named **Elara** was chosen by **Ilmater** (god of compassion and endurance) and transformed into **Serenity Truthweaver**, the Prophet of Reconciliation.

### Her Divine Gifts
- **The Voice of All Sorrows**: She could speak and be understood by any being, in words that touched their deepest pain
- **The Eyes of Shared Pain**: Those who looked into her eyes experienced the suffering they had caused others
- **The Touch of Understanding**: Her touch allowed bitter enemies to truly understand each other's perspectives

### The Teaching
Serenity didn't preach peace through weakness. Instead, she taught the **Doctrine of Threefold Truth**:
1. "All claims to the Heart are true, for truth is not singular but prismatic"
2. "To claim sole ownership is to shatter the very thing you seek"
3. "Only in unity can the Heart be whole, only in division does reality break"

## The Resolution: The Binding of the Heart

### The Ritual of Three-As-One
Serenity guided the leaders in a ritual that required:
- **Dwarven Craft**: Forging a chamber that could contain paradox
- **Elven Magic**: Weaving a spell that allowed multiple truths to coexist
- **Draconic Essence**: Each dragon contributing a scale, metallic and chromatic together

### The Great Renunciation
Each race had to give up their exclusive claim:
- Dwarves acknowledged the Heart wasn't just a forge
- Elves accepted it wasn't merely Corellon's tear
- Dragons admitted it wasn't only Io's egg
- The Illithids were forced to reveal themselves and pledge to never manipulate the races again

### The Sundering Seal
The Heart was successfully stabilized but at a cost:
- It was sealed away in a pocket dimension accessible only when all three races agreed
- The reality damage was repaired, but scars remained
- A portion of Serenity's essence was bound into the seal as an eternal guardian

## Traces for Adventurers

### Physical Remnants

#### The Truthstones
Scattered throughout the region are **Truthstones**—fragments of the chamber that held the Heart:
- Glow when near deception or illusion
- Force anyone touching them to speak only truth for 24 hours
- When brought together, might reveal the Heart's hidden location

#### Sunderscars
Places where reality was damaged show peculiar properties:
- **Time Eddies**: Pockets where time moves differently (seconds pass as hours, or vice versa)
- **Gravity Wells**: Areas where up and down are matters of perspective
- **Memory Pools**: Springs that show visions of the war to those who drink

#### The Peace Trees
Where Serenity walked, unique trees grew with silver bark and golden leaves:
- Their sap can calm any emotion or cure madness
- Birds nesting in them sing in celestial tongues
- They're slowly dying, and no one knows why

### Artifacts

#### Weapons of Unmaking
Occasionally found but incredibly dangerous:
- **Voidsteel Blades**: Cut through anything but slowly erase the wielder's memories
- **Temporal Arrows**: Hit targets in the past, present, and future simultaneously
- **Dragon-Paradox Scales**: Armor that exists in multiple states until observed

#### The Compassion Bells
Seven bells forged from Serenity's tears:
- Each produces a note that induces profound empathy
- When all seven ring together, they can summon Serenity's spirit
- Three are lost, two are known, two are hidden

### Living Echoes

#### The Reconciled
Immortal witnesses who were touched by Serenity:
- Cannot die until the Heart is needed again
- Each guards a piece of crucial knowledge
- They appear as wanderers, testing adventurers' wisdom

#### The Sundered Ones
Beings caught in the reality storm:
- Exist partially in multiple planes simultaneously
- Phase in and out of existence
- Desperate to become "whole" again

#### Dream Fragments of the War
The psychic residue sometimes manifests:
- Shared nightmares that affect entire towns
- Phantom battles that play out with real consequences
- Whispers that teach lost magical techniques

### The Forbidden Knowledge

#### The Fourth Participant
Evidence of the Illithids' involvement was magically suppressed:
- Ancient texts have gaps where their name should be
- Discovering their role might break ancient treaties
- They still watch from the Underdark, waiting

#### The Heart's True Nature
What if all three races were wrong?
- Prophecies suggest the Heart is something far more dangerous
- Perhaps it's a prison for something that should never be released
- Or maybe it's counting down to something

#### Serenity's Sacrifice
The prophet didn't simply disappear:
- She became part of the seal itself
- Some say she can still be contacted in places of great suffering
- Her compassion might be the only thing keeping the Heart stable

## Current Threats

### The Seal Weakens
Signs that worry scholars:
- Peace Trees dying without explanation
- Truthstones cracking and leaking liquid light
- Reconciled reporting shared dreams of Serenity screaming

### The Inheritors
Extremist factions in each race seek to reclaim "their" Heart:
- **The Hammers of Reclamation** (Dwarven fundamentalists)
- **The Starlight Court** (Elven revanchists)  
- **The Dragons of the First Egg** (Draconic supremacists)

### The Hidden Manipulators
The Illithids never forgave their forced revelation:
- They seek to shatter the peace and reclaim their shadows
- Cultists called **The Forgotten Thought** work to find the Heart
- Strange coincidences bring the three races into conflict again
