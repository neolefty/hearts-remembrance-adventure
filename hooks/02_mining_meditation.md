# The Mining Meditation

## Hook Summary
Dwarf prospectors are hiring guides to specific coordinates, claiming to seek new ore. One team has vanished.

## Background
- Clan Truthforge sent advance scouts months ago
- They're measuring distances between ancient markers
- The missing team found something they weren't prepared for
- Local miners resent these "outsiders" taking the best guides

## Key NPCs
- **Thorek Ironfoot**: Lead prospector, terrible liar, sweats when questioned
- **Gundren Rockseeker**: Knows something's up, offers to help for a cut
- **Nilsa Stonehill**: Lost her son with the missing team

## Investigation Clues
- DC 10 Insight: The dwarves aren't actually looking at the rocks
- DC 13 Investigation: Their maps show astronomical alignments, not geological features
- DC 16 Perception: They whisper prayers to Moradin about "keeping the peace"

## The Missing Team Location
**Echoing Depths**: A cave system 3 hours into the hills
- Strange acoustics - whispers carry for miles
- Truthstone embedded in central chamber
- Missing dwarves in magical sleep around it

## Encounters
- **Stone Guardians**: Ancient constructs protecting the Truthstone
- **Gibbering Mouther**: Formed from miners who tried to chip the Truthstone
- **The Sleepers**: The missing team (non-hostile if awakened carefully)

## Rewards
- 50 gp per day as guides
- 500 gp for finding the missing team
- Truthstone Fragment (if they're clever about extracting it)
- Clan Truthforge's gratitude (useful later)

## Hidden Truth
The dwarves are mapping the Heart's emergence location using an ancient formula. The Truthstone overwhelmed the missing team with visions of the original Sundering.

## Connections
- The astronomical charts match the timing of strange dreams
- Thorek might let slip about "the Remembrance" if pressed
- The Truthstone shows visions of Daran as a younger man
