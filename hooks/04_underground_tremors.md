## Hook Summary
Wells act strangely - water levels fluctuate, odd sounds emerge, and one well briefly glowed.

## Background
- House Mel'thiir travels ancient Underdark passages
- Their magic disturbs long-dormant water systems
- They're avoiding main routes due to Lolth loyalist assassins
- Local wildlife flees upward from their passage

## Key NPCs
- **Harbin Wester**: Townmaster, demands immediate action
- **Widow Thorne**: Her well glowed, now she has prophetic dreams
- **Droop**: Former goblin prisoner, terrified of "spider people"

## Investigation Clues
- DC 12 Perception: Wells echo with distant singing
- DC 14 Arcana: Water has traces of Underdark minerals
- DC 17 Investigation: The glow pattern matches holy symbols of Eilistraee

## Descending Below
**The Forgotten Cisterns**: Ancient water system beneath Phandalin
- Built by the original settlers centuries ago
- Now connects to Underdark passages
- Drow pilgrims camping in hidden chambers
- Assassin bodies suggesting recent combat

## Encounters
- **Underdark Refugees**: Cave fishers, darkmantles fleeing upward
- **Drow Scouts**: Suspicious but not hostile (if approached carefully)
- **Lolth Assassins**: Still hunting the delegation

## Rewards
- 300 gp from town treasury
- Widow Thorne's heirloom ring (protection from poison)
- Healing fungus samples from grateful drow
- Map of safe Underdark passages

## Hidden Truth
The drow are refugees seeking redemption at the Remembrance. The well water now carries traces of their goddess Eilistraee's blessing, granting prophetic dreams to some.

## Connections
- Drow mention "ancient promises" and "the Heart's call"
- Their route avoids main paths like they're following old maps
- Widow Thorne's dreams show Daran speaking to crowds
