# The Old Friend's Favor

## Hook Summary
Daran's "old adventuring companion" reports strange sounds from Cragmaw Cave. He's too old to investigate himself.

## Background
- Githyanki scouts use the abandoned cave as a base
- They're debating whether to approach openly
- Still traumatized by their people's past failure
- The "old friend" is actually a Reconciled immortal

## Key NPCs
- **Daran Edermath**: Wistful about his "adventuring days"
- **Zetch'r'r the Humbled**: Githyanki leader, proud but broken
- **Silent Keth**: Young githyanki who wants to trust surface-dwellers

## Investigation Clues
- DC 11 Survival: Fresh tracks, but whoever made them tried to hide
- DC 14 Perception: Silver cloth scraps on thorns
- DC 16 History: Githyanki military signals carved in trees

## Cragmaw Cave Changes
- Githyanki have cleaned and organized it
- Meditation circles drawn in silver dust
- Maps of the region with question marks
- A shrine to redemption (unusual for githyanki)

## Encounters
- **Githyanki Scouts**: Initially hostile, then defensive
- **Psychic Echoes**: Remnants of githyanki shame (Wisdom saves)
- **Trust Challenge**: Social encounter to convince them to emerge

## Rewards
- Daran's +1 shortsword "Peaceholder"
- Githyanki silver cloth (resistance to psychic damage)
- Potential alliance with the Silvered Chain
- Knowledge of what happens when delegations don't attend

## Hidden Truth
The githyanki are here to break their cycle of isolation. If treated with respect, they'll share the tale of their 147 years of civil war after missing the last Remembrance.

## Connections
- Githyanki mention "the Watchers" told them it was time
- They have a broken Truthstone they've been trying to repair
- Zetch'r'r has heard of Daran but doesn't know he's in Phandalin
