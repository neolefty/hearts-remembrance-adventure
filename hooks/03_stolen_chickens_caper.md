# The Stolen Chickens Caper

## Hook Summary
Someone steals chickens but leaves payment. The chickens return days later with tiny bells attached.

## Background
- Kobold scouts arrived two weeks ago
- They believe all surface activities are elaborate traps
- "Borrowing" chickens to test for poison, curses, and explosions
- The bells are safety devices (they think)

## Key NPCs
- **Barthen**: Frustrated but puzzled by the payments
- **Thistle Greenleaf**: Halfling child who claims to have seen "tiny dragons"
- **Skrix the Overprepared**: Kobold scout leader (if encountered)

## Investigation Clues
- DC 11 Survival: Tiny clawed footprints near coops
- DC 14 Investigation: Payment always equals exact market value plus 10%
- DC 15 Perception: Bells have tiny runes that say "SAFE" in Draconic

## Following the Trail
**The Testing Ground**: Hidden ravine outside town
- Elaborate "chicken testing facility"
- Charts tracking each chicken's "trap resistance"
- 17 chickens in various stages of "safety improvement"
- Emergency evacuation tunnels everywhere

## Encounters
- **Kobold Safety Squad**: 6 kobolds conducting "Phase 3 testing"
- **Angry Rooster**: Enhanced with "protection protocols" (AC 15)
- **Trapstorm**: If threatened, kobolds activate ALL the traps

## Rewards
- 100 gp from Barthen
- Store credit (25 gp value)
- "Safety Chicken" - trained to detect traps (maybe?)
- Kobold Friendship (if handled diplomatically)

## Hidden Truth
The kobolds are advance scouts for their delegation. They're testing if surface-dwellers can be trusted by seeing how they react to the "improved" chickens.

## Connections
- Kobolds mention "the great gathering trap"
- Their charts include measurements similar to the dwarves'
- Skrix has a sketch of Daran labeled "Prime Suspect"
