*[‚Üê Previous: Refugee's Riddle](07_refugees_riddle.md) | [Back to Adventure Hooks](../early_adventure_hooks.md)*

## Hook Summary
Wolves near town act strangely - not hunting, just watching. One was reportedly heard speaking.

## Background
- Brightfang leads awakened animal scouts
- They're evaluating if humanoids can be trusted
- Previous encounters with hunters went poorly
- They seek recognition at the Remembrance

## Key NPCs
- **Sister Garaele**: Concerned about unnatural behavior
- **Brightfang the Eloquent**: Awakened wolf philosopher
- **Thorn**: Awakened wolf who distrusts "two-legs"
- **Old Henrik**: Trapper who swears a wolf asked him about justice

## Investigation Clues
- DC 12 Animal Handling: The wolves aren't aggressive, just curious
- DC 14 Insight: Their behavior suggests intelligence and purpose
- DC 17 Nature: Pack dynamics are wrong - they're debating, not hunting

## The Parliament Grove
**Ancient Meeting Place**: Where awakened animals gather
- Sacred to druids but forgotten by most
- Currently hosts heated debates
- Brightfang argues for peace, others for isolation
- Evidence of previous human violence

## Encounters
- **Suspicious Pack**: Regular wolves protective of awakened kin
- **The Philosophical Challenge**: Brightfang's test of ethics
- **Hunter's Mistake**: Trappers who don't realize these wolves are special

## Rewards
- Healing potions from Sister Garaele
- Blessing of Tymora (reroll one d20)
- Awakened Guide (wolf companion for one adventure)
- Translation of the animal debates about the Remembrance

## Hidden Truth
The awakened animals debate whether to reveal themselves at the Remembrance. They fear being treated as pets or threats rather than equals. Success here ensures their participation.

## Connections
- Brightfang mentions "the walking tree" (Mosswhisper)
- They've been watching Daran's orchard transformations
- Old Henrik's grandfather told stories of "when beasts could speak"
