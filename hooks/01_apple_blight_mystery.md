# The Apple Blight Mystery

*[← Back to Adventure Hooks](../early_adventure_hooks.md) | [Next: Mining Meditation →](02_mining_meditation.md)*

## Hook Summary
Daran Edermath's prized apple trees are dying from a strange silvery blight. Local farmers fear for the harvest.

## Background
- Peace Trees throughout the region are beginning to transform
- The "blight" appears as silver veins through bark and leaves
- Affected trees drop fruit that tastes of starlight and memories
- Animals that eat the fruit act strangely peaceful

## Key NPCs
- **Daran Edermath**: Worried but strangely philosophical about his trees
- **Farmer Alford**: Panicking about his livelihood
- **Old Marta**: Claims she's seen this before, but she was "just a child"

## Investigation Clues
- DC 12 Nature: The blight spreads in a pattern, like it's following something underground
- DC 15 Arcana: Faint divination magic emanates from affected trees
- DC 18 History: Similar events in old records, roughly 150 years ago

## Encounters
- **Blight-Maddened Bear**: Normally docile, driven aggressive by transformation energies
- **Silvered Sprites**: Tiny fey drawn to the changing trees, speaking in riddles

## Rewards
- 200 gp from concerned farmers
- Daran's special cider (grants peaceful sleep, prevents nightmares for 1 week)
- A silver apple that never spoils (could be useful later?)

## Hidden Truth
The trees are awakening to their connection to the ancient Peace Trees, preparing for the Heart's emergence. The "blight" is actually a blessing, but appears as death to those who don't understand.

## Connections
- Daran might drop hints about "cycles" and "necessary changes"
- The silver apple resonates near Truthstones
- Old Marta could be convinced to share stories of the last Remembrance
