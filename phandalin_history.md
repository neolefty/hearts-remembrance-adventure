# The Hidden History of Phandalin Region

## Ancient Timeline

### The Age of the Delzoun Dwarves (1,000+ years ago)
- **The Forge of Spells wasn't the only magical site.** Deep beneath the Sword Mountains, the dwarves discovered the **Starfall Sanctum**, where a massive meteorite of pure starsteel crashed millennia ago. They built a temple around it, using its celestial energies to craft legendary weapons.
- **The Pact of Three Hammers:** The dwarven clans of Wave Echo Cave, Starfall Sanctum, and a third lost holdfast called **Irondeep** swore a blood oath to defend against the growing orc hordes. When Irondeep fell, its location was magically erased from all maps and memories as a final desperate act.

### The Orc Invasions (500 years ago)
- **The Battle of Bleeding Stone:** A massive orc army led by **Warlord Ghazk the Defiler** besieged Phandalin. The town's defenders made a last stand at a granite outcropping that ran red with blood. Legend says the stone still weeps crimson tears during the anniversary.
- **The Lost Legion:** An entire company of 300 human soldiers vanished while pursuing orcs into the Neverwinter Wood. Some say they were cursed to wander the forest as spirits, still hunting their quarry.

### The Spellplague Era (100 years ago)
- **The Twisted Tower:** When the Spellplague struck, a wizard's tower near Phandalin was caught in a pocket of wild magic. It now exists partially in the Feywild, appearing and disappearing according to lunar cycles.
- **The Plague Stones:** Strange crystalline formations grew overnight in a ring around the region. They still hum with residual magic and cause unpredictable effects to those who touch them.

## Recent Events (Last 50 years)

### The Dragon of Icespire Peak
- **Before Cryovain:** The white dragon's lair was once home to **Aurixalar the Brass**, a benevolent dragon who protected the region. Her hoard included a library of ancient knowledge. When she died of old age, her death curse was meant to keep evil dragons away—but it failed.
- **The Frozen Monastery:** A monastery dedicated to Bahamut was flash-frozen with all its monks inside when they refused to bow to a young Cryovain. They may still be alive in magical stasis.

### The Redbrands' True Purpose
- **The Zhentarim Connection:** Glasstaff wasn't just forming a gang—he was searching for the **Delver's Testament**, a dwarven artifact that supposedly reveals the location of all lost dwarven holds in the region.
- **The Black Spider's Mentor:** Nezznar learned of Wave Echo Cave from **Syldar's Betrayer**, a shapeshifter who had infiltrated the Lords' Alliance years ago and is still at large.

## Mysteries and Rumors

### The Whispering Hillock
Three miles east of Phandalin stands a barren hill where no plants grow. Locals say that on foggy nights, voices speaking in ancient Dwarvish can be heard arguing about "the sealed door that must never open."

### The Moonwell Murders  
Every 7 years, on the night of the Harvest Moon, someone disappears near the old elven moonwell in Neverwinter Wood. The victims are found days later with silver eyes and no memory, speaking prophecies in Sylvan before returning to normal.

### The Phandalin Witch
Old timers speak of **Agatha's Sister**, a night hag named **Morvena** who once cursed the town's well. She was driven off but not killed, and some say she still haunts the Triboar Trail, seeking revenge on the descendants of those who wronged her.

### The Sunless Garden
Deep in the Sword Mountains lies a valley where the sun never shines, yet plants grow in abundance—all of them black as midnight. Drow refugees from Menzoberranzan allegedly cultivate poison there, trading with surface dwellers brave enough to find them.

## Current Threats and Opportunities

### The Cult of the Watching Eye
Strange symbols have been appearing on trees and stones: an unblinking eye wreathed in tentacles. Travelers report disturbing dreams and missing time after camping near these marks.

### The Merchant Prince's Interest
A wealthy Waterdhavian merchant named **Lord Zelindor Rhavos** has been quietly buying land around Phandalin. He claims to be interested in "archaeological preservation" but his hired thugs suggest otherwise.

### The Awakening Construct
Farmers have reported seeing a massive iron golem, covered in runes and vegetation, slowly walking through the wilderness. It seems to be heading somewhere with purpose, ignoring all attempts at communication.

## Notable Locations for Adventure

### Irondeep's Hidden Entrance
**Hook:** A mad hermit claims to have found a door that "shouldn't exist" while fleeing wolves in the mountains. The door bears dwarven runes that hurt to look at directly.

### The Starfall Sanctum
**Hook:** The recent earthquake that revealed Wave Echo Cave also opened a passage in the mountains. Strange lights have been seen at night, and metal objects within miles are beginning to vibrate with an unknown resonance.

### The Plaguelands
**Hook:** Where the Plague Stones form their ring, reality is thin. Creatures from other planes sometimes slip through, and magic items behave unpredictably. A desperate merchant offers a fortune to anyone who can retrieve his caravan lost within.

### The Tower Between Worlds
**Hook:** The Twisted Tower has appeared for the first time in three years. Previous expeditions found rooms that led to the Feywild, but none who entered those rooms ever returned. This time, lights can be seen in its windows, and music drifts on the wind.
