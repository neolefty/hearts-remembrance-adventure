# The Remembrance of the Heart

## The Cycle of Return

Approximately every **150 years**, the Heart of the Mountain emerges from its pocket dimension. The exact timing is mysterious—sometimes it comes after 143 years, sometimes 157, following rhythms known only to itself. Most who witness one Remembrance will never see another, making each emergence precious and somewhat mythical to the common folk.

The Heart manifests for **three days and three nights**, though even this can vary slightly, like a living thing drawing breath.

### Signs of Approach
The signs vary with each emergence, as organic and unpredictable as the seasons, but may include:

**Years before** (typically 2-5 years):
- The Reconciled (immortal witnesses) grow restless and begin traveling
- Ancient texts in libraries glow faintly when touched
- Children born with silver streaks in their hair increase

**Months before** (typically 3-8 months):
- Peace Trees may bloom out of season—or all their leaves turn gold
- Some years, flocks of white ravens appear; other times, wolves howl in harmony
- Truthstones warm to the touch, though some years they sing instead

**Weeks before** (typically 2-6 weeks):
- Old feuds feel hollow; enemies find excuses to avoid conflict
- Dreams increase—sometimes of Elara's voice, sometimes of walking in starlight
- The weather becomes unusually mild, though one emergence brought gentle snow in summer

## The Ritual of Opening

### The Gathering Place
The Heart emerges at **Serenity's Grove**, a natural amphitheater in the foothills three hours' walk from Phandalin. The grove remains sacred year-round, maintained by an order of contemplatives called the **Servants of Remembrance**.

### The Traditional Representatives

The original three:
- **For the Dwarves**: Usually a master craftsperson, chosen by demonstrating wisdom over skill
- **For the Elves**: Traditionally a keeper of songs, one who preserves the oral histories
- **For the Dragons**: A drake or half-dragon who speaks for dragonkind (full dragons rarely attend anymore)

Added over the centuries:
- **For Humanity**: Representing the "younger races" who emerged after the Sundering
- **For the Small Folk**: Halflings and gnomes, who proved their wisdom deserved recognition
- **For the Wanderers**: Those without homeland - often a representative of mixed heritage
- **For the Wild**: A druid or ranger speaking for nature itself

### The Ritual Requirements

**Not Rigid but Flexible**: The ritual has evolved to be remarkably adaptive:
- If a race cannot send a representative, another may "hold their place in trust"
- New peoples can be recognized if they demonstrate understanding of the Heart's lesson
- The minimum requirement is simply three representatives, though seven is traditional
- Representatives need not be pure-blooded; the Heart recognizes cultural allegiance over bloodline

### The Opening Words
Spoken in unison by all representatives:
*"We come not as claimants but as children*
*Not as owners but as guardians*
*In our diversity, we find strength*
*In our unity, we preserve the world"*

## The Three Days of Remembrance

### First Day: The Sorrow
- Representatives share stories of conflicts from the past century and a half
- Each admits their people's failures and mistakes
- The Heart projects visions of what unchecked conflict could unleash
- Elara's presence is felt as a gentle sadness for necessary pain

### Second Day: The Understanding  
- Representatives exchange gifts that represent their cultures' contributions
- They participate in each other's cultural practices
- The Heart glows brighter as unity strengthens
- Elara's laughter can be heard in the wind as old enemies become friends

### Third Day: The Renewal
- New oaths of friendship are sworn, not binding but aspirational
- Young people are brought to witness and learn
- The Heart reveals visions of cooperation and shared prosperity
- Elara's blessing manifests as a warm light that heals old wounds

## The Current Crisis

### The Missing Dragon
For the first time in over 300 years, **no dragon representative has announced their intention to attend**. The reasons are unclear:
- The ancient dragon **Othokent the Sapphire**, who usually sends a representative, has been silent
- Young dragons seem uninterested in "ancient ceremonies"
- Rumors suggest chromatic and metallic dragons are feuding again over territory

### New Peoples Seeking Recognition
- **The Orcish Confederation of the Northern Reaches** has sent an embassy requesting representation
- **Refugee Drow** from the Underdark, fleeing their cruel society, wish to prove they've changed
- **Awakened Beings** (animals given sentience by druids) believe they deserve a voice

### The Consequences of Absence
The ritual is remarkably resilient—it will proceed even with missing representatives. However, those peoples who fail to send a representative forfeit their blessing:
- **For the absent people**: They receive no renewal of Elara's grace, making conflicts more likely among them
- **For the ritual**: The Heart dims slightly for each absence, but still functions
- **For the region**: The overall peace holds, but with noticeable gaps where the absent peoples dwell

The ritual has survived missing representatives before—twice the dwarves were absent due to deep wars, once no elf could attend during a plague. The Heart's wisdom adapts, though it grieves each absence.

## Adventure Opportunities

### Finding the Dragon Representative
- **Investigate** why Othokent has gone silent (illness? Depression? Threat?)
- **Convince** a younger dragon to take responsibility 
- **Discover** if the dragon absence is due to manipulation by those who want the ritual to fail
- **Alternative**: Find a worthy dragonborn, half-dragon, or drake willing to stand for all dragonkind

### Validating New Representatives
- **Test** the orcish embassy's sincerity through trials of wisdom and compassion
- **Verify** the reformed drow aren't infiltrators with hidden agendas
- **Mediate** between those who accept new peoples and traditionalists who resist change

### Protecting the Ritual
- **Guard** traveling representatives from those who profit from conflict
- **Investigate** strange accidents befalling past representatives
- **Uncover** why some Truthstones have been stolen or destroyed recently

### The Deeper Mystery
- **Why** are the Peace Trees showing signs of extraordinary health rather than decline?
- **What** is the significance of seven new stars appearing in the constellation of Ilmater?
- **Who** is the mysterious figure in white seen near Serenity's Grove at midnight?

## Rewards of Success

### When the Ritual Completes
- Each participating people receives the Heart's blessing for the coming age
- Representatives gain a **Shard of Understanding** (magical item promoting empathy)
- The party gains **Elara's Grace** if they helped the ritual succeed
- Those peoples who participated find cooperation easier, trade flourishes, and conflicts resolve more readily

### The Strength of the Ritual
The Heart has never failed to appear, even during the worst times:
- During the **Century of Shadows**, only three representatives came, yet the Heart still emerged
- When plague prevented travel, local residents stood as emergency representatives
- The ritual's resilience is itself part of Elara's teaching: peace persists through dedication, not perfection

## Notes on Elara's Presence

When the Heart fully manifests, Elara doesn't appear physically but her presence is undeniable:
- Her voice offers personal guidance to each representative
- She remembers every previous ceremony and can share wisdom from the past
- Those touched by her presence cannot commit violence for a full month afterward
- Children born during the three days are said to be natural peacemakers

Her most powerful gift is **The Moment of Perfect Understanding** - for just an instant, everyone present truly comprehends everyone else's perspective completely. This experience is so profound that many spend the rest of their lives trying to recapture that feeling of absolute connection.
