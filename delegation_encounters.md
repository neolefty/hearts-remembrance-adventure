# The Gathering of Delegates

## The Mystery of Location

The Heart doesn't emerge in the same place each time. The last emergence was at Serenity's Grove, but that was 147 years ago. The location shifts according to needs unknown—perhaps where peace is most fragile, or where the land itself calls out.

### The Seeking Stones
Ancient **Truthstones** scattered throughout the region begin resonating as the Heart approaches. When three or more are brought together, they pull gently toward the emergence site—but delegates must cooperate to gather enough stones to triangulate the location.

## The Hidden Delegate: Daran Edermath

The old half-elf orchard keeper of Phandalin carries a secret heavier than his years suggest. **Daran Edermath** is the last delegate of the **Watchers of the First Peace**—descendants of those who witnessed Elara's original teaching. His order has dwindled to perhaps a dozen souls scattered across the Sword Coast, but they remember.

### Why Daran Hides
- His order guards knowledge that some would exploit—the true names of the Reconciled, the words that can summon memories from Truthstones
- He poses as a simple retired adventurer to avoid those who might force him to reveal the Heart's patterns
- He's been waiting, tending his orchard, watching for the signs he learned as a child

### The Revelation
When the party has earned his trust (perhaps through their actions in Lost Mine), Daran might:
- "Accidentally" show them his **Delegate's Mark**—a silver tattoo that appears only in moonlight
- Share old stories that are suspiciously detailed about the last Remembrance
- Gift them an apple from a tree grown from a seed of the Peace Trees

## Early Signs: The Delegations Arrive

### The Chastened Return
**First Sign**: Silver-skinned warriors seen at dawn, moving like they're afraid to disturb the air
- Local militia report "invaders" who bow and retreat when spotted
- Merchants find payment left for goods no one saw taken
- Children report "sad knights" watching them play

**The Delegation**: The Githyanki of the **Silvered Chain**
- Led by **Zetch'r'r the Humbled**, who wears her shame like armor
- Once commanded hundreds; now grateful for the six who still follow
- They missed the last Remembrance out of pride—147 years of civil war followed
- Brings gifts but expects nothing, prepared for rejection

## Other Delegations

### The Dwarven Preparers
**First Sign**: Prospectors appear in the hills, but they're not looking for ore
- Measuring distances between standing stones
- Purchasing every scrap of silver in Phandalin
- Setting up camps with ceremonial braziers that burn with blue flame

**The Delegation**: Clan Truthforge sends **Master Artificer Thorina Goldspeak**
- A young dwarf (barely 50) chosen for her innovative spirit over traditional seniority
- Brings a contingent of apprentices who double as guards
- Seeks to prove that youth can honor ancient traditions

### The Whispers from Below
**First Sign**: Wells in Phandalin run strange—water tastes of distant rain, sometimes glows faintly
- Cave fishers and other Underdark creatures flee upward
- Miners report hearing singing in languages they don't recognize
- Truthstones deep underground pulse in rhythm

**The Delegation**: Reformed Drow from **House Mel'thiir** (House of Redemption)
- Led by **Velara Mel'thiir**, a priestess who turned from Lolth to Eilistraee
- Travel by night, camp underground by day
- Bring gifts of spider silk and fungal medicines to prove good intentions

### The Wild's Awakening
**First Sign**: Nature itself grows strange around Phandalin
- Trees lean toward something unseen
- Animals gather in mixed groups, predator and prey together
- Flowers bloom in spirals that point toward the Heart's emergence

**The Delegation**: The **Elderoak Parliament**—awakened trees and their druid shepherds
- **Speaker Mosswhisper**, an awakened oak who remembers the last three Remembrances
- Travels as a walking grove, roots connecting underground
- Seeks recognition for plant consciousness in the ritual

### The Wanderer's Caravan
**First Sign**: Refugees and travelers converge on Phandalin without knowing why
- Each carries a small trade good or story from distant lands
- They speak of dreams calling them to "the gathering"
- No two share the same homeland

**The Delegation**: The **Roadhearts**—those without nation who claim the road itself
- Led by **Grandmother Safa**, a human woman who seems every age at once
- Actually a collective delegation representing dozens of displaced peoples
- Brings the wisdom that home is not a place but the connections between people

### The Unexpected Arrivals
**First Sign**: Orcs approach under peace banners
- Set up camps following ancient hospitality laws
- Bring gifts of salted meat and worked leather
- Their shamans seek audiences with local clergy

**The Delegation**: The **Broken Tusk Confederation**
- **Chieftain Mokran the Poet**, an orc who speaks in verse and values words over weapons
- Seeks to prove orcs have grown beyond their violent past
- Brings young orcs who have never known constant war

## The Comedy of Confusion

As delegations arrive, Phandalin becomes wonderfully chaotic:
- The inn runs out of rooms (trees don't fit through doors)
- Dietary restrictions clash (what do you feed an awakened plant?)
- Translation mishaps abound (the drow word for "peace" sounds like the dwarvish word for "collapse")
- Everyone's looking for these mysterious Truthstones
- Nobody's quite sure where they're supposed to go

## Daran's Guidance

As tensions rise and confusion mounts, Daran might finally reveal himself:
- He knows the old protocols for greeting each delegation
- He can teach the party the signs to watch for the Heart's emergence
- Most importantly, he remembers Elara's core teaching: "In confusion, find laughter. In difference, find strength."

## Adventure Hooks

### The Stone Hunt
- Each delegation has perhaps one Truthstone
- More are scattered in dangerous locations
- Cooperation between unlikely allies is needed to gather enough

### The Missing Dragon
- Still no dragon delegate has appeared
- Is this connected to the recent dragon troubles in the region?
- Perhaps a young wyrmling in Phandalin could serve, if convinced

### The Saboteur
- Someone spreads rumors to turn delegations against each other
- Ancient prejudices are inflamed
- Who benefits from the ritual failing?

### The Test of Understanding
- The Heart won't emerge until the delegations demonstrate unity
- Traditional competitions of skill become opportunities for cooperation
- The party must help orchestrate moments of connection

## The Human Element

Each delegate brings personal stakes:
- **Thorina** struggles with traditionalist dwarves who think she's too young
- **Velara** faces assassination attempts from Lolth loyalists
- **Mosswhisper** must convince other trees that mobile life deserves trust
- **Grandmother Safa** juggles the needs of dozens of refugee populations
- **Mokran** knows one violent incident could destroy orc credibility forever

The party's role becomes helping these individuals succeed, not just as delegates but as people bridging ancient divides with hope and determination.
