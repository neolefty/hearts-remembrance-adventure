# Development Notes - Heart's Remembrance Campaign

## What We've Created

### Core Concept
- **Ancient conflict** (War of Sundering) that nearly destroyed reality through competing mythological claims
- **Peace ritual** that transforms potential conflict into renewal every ~150 years
- **Living tradition** where each generation experiences the ceremony, keeping lessons fresh

### Key Design Decisions
- Made the ritual **resilient** - missing delegations hurt themselves more than the whole
- Added **mysterious timing** (143-157 years) with organic, variable signs
- Shifted from cosmic threats to **personal, relatable stakes**
- Used **Daran Edermath** from Lost Mine as the hidden wisdom keeper
- Created **diverse delegations** each with internal conflicts and goals

### Documents Created
1. `war_of_sundering.md` - The mythic past
2. `heart_remembrance_ritual.md` - How the peace is maintained
3. `phandalin_history.md` - Regional hooks and mysteries
4. `delegation_encounters.md` - Meeting the delegations
5. `delegations_list.md` - Quick reference for all groups

## Next Steps for Practical Campaign

### Immediate Needs
1. **Session 0-3 Outlines**
   - How to introduce the signs gradually
   - When to reveal Daran's secret
   - Pacing the delegation arrivals

2. **NPC Stats & Personalities**
   - Detailed character sheets for key delegates
   - Quick personality traits for minor delegation members
   - Potential combat stats (just in case)

3. **Truthstone Mechanics**
   - Where to find them (mini-dungeons?)
   - Mechanical benefits for gathering them
   - How they reveal the Heart's location

4. **The Dragon Problem**
   - Why are dragons absent?
   - Options for dragon representatives
   - Consequences if none appear

### Adventure Hooks to Develop
1. **The Saboteur** - Who benefits from failure?
2. **Inter-delegation Conflicts** - Specific friction points
3. **Missing Representatives** - Rescue missions
4. **New Peoples' Tests** - Proving worthiness
5. **The Mysterious Figure in White** - Friend or foe?

### Mechanical Elements Needed
1. **Blessings of Elara** - Mechanical benefits
2. **Shards of Understanding** - Magic item stats
3. **Ritual Participation** - Skill challenges?
4. **Peace Tree Sap** - Healing properties
5. **Delegation Reputation** - Tracking system

### World-Building Opportunities
1. **Previous Remembrances** - What happened 150, 300, 450 years ago?
2. **Failed Delegations** - Which peoples lost their blessings?
3. **The Reconciled** - More immortal witnesses to meet
4. **Regional Politics** - How does Waterdeep/Neverwinter view this?
5. **The Illithid Secret** - How much do they still manipulate?

### DM Tools Needed
1. **Random Delegation Encounters** table
2. **Signs of the Heart's Approach** checklist
3. **Phandalin during the Gathering** - Inn prices, crowd scenes
4. **Delegation Relationships** tracker
5. **Ritual Success Conditions** flowchart

## Design Philosophy Going Forward

- **Personal Over Cosmic**: Keep stakes human-sized
- **Cooperation Over Combat**: Fights should be last resort
- **Mystery Over Certainty**: Nobody fully understands the Heart
- **Growth Over Victory**: Success means transformation, not winning
- **Flexible Over Rigid**: Adapt to player creativity

## Questions to Answer

1. What if players want to prevent the ritual?
2. How to handle PC delegates (if party includes qualifying races)?
3. What happens if the Heart emerges in a dangerous location?
4. Can the ritual be corrupted rather than stopped?
5. How do other regions handle their own peace-keeping?

## Session Zero Questions for DM

- How much do PCs know about the Remembrance initially?
- Are any PCs connected to delegations?
- What's the party's relationship with Daran?
- How comfortable are players with social/political challenges?
- What tone: serious diplomacy or comedic culture clash?
