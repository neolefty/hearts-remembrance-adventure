# Early Adventure Hooks - The Quiet Before the Gathering

*For a party of 3-5 adventurers, currently level 5*

## Hooks from Around Phandalin

### 1. [The Apple Blight Mystery](hooks/01_apple_blight_mystery.md)
**Source**: Local farmers
**The Hook**: Daran Edermath's prized apple trees are dying, along with several other orchards. A strange silvery blight spreads from tree to tree. Farmers fear it will destroy the harvest.
**The Truth**: The Peace Trees' distant cousins are reacting to the approaching Remembrance, shedding their earthly forms. The "blight" is actually a transformation.
**Reward**: 200 gp from concerned farmers, plus Daran's special cider
**Combat**: Blight-maddened animals, possible plant creatures

### 2. [The Mining Meditation](hooks/02_mining_meditation.md)
**Source**: Phandalin Miner's Exchange
**The Hook**: Dwarf prospectors are paying top coin for guides to specific coordinates in the hills. They claim to be looking for a new type of ore but refuse to say more. One team hasn't returned.
**The Truth**: Clan Truthforge's advance scouts are measuring ley lines. The missing team found a Truthstone in a cave system.
**Reward**: 50 gp per day as guides, 500 gp for finding the missing team
**Combat**: Cave hazards, possibly creatures guarding the Truthstone

### 3. [The Stolen Chickens Caper](hooks/03_stolen_chickens_caper.md)
**Source**: Barthen's Provisions
**The Hook**: Someone is stealing chickens - but leaving payment. Even stranger, the chickens reappear days later with tiny silver bells on their legs. Barthen wants answers.
**The Truth**: Kobold scouts are "borrowing" chickens to test for traps and danger, then returning them "improved"
**Reward**: 100 gp and store credit
**Combat**: Kobold "security measures," misunderstandings that escalate

### 4. [The Underground Tremors](hooks/04_underground_tremors.md)
**Source**: Harbin Wester (the townmaster)
**The Hook**: Wells are acting strange - water levels rising and falling, strange sounds from below. One well even glowed briefly. Citizens demand action.
**The Truth**: Drow delegation traveling through the Underdark below, their passage disturbing ancient waterways
**Reward**: 300 gp from town funds
**Combat**: Underdark creatures fleeing upward, possible drow scouts (non-lethal)

## Daran's "Unrelated" Requests

### 5. [The Family Heirloom](hooks/05_family_heirloom.md)
**Source**: Daran Edermath
**The Hook**: Daran's getting old and wants to pass down a family heirloom to his "nephew" in Triboar. He needs escorts for the journey. The box must not be opened.
**The Truth**: The box contains a Truthstone. The "nephew" is another Watcher. Daran is testing if the party can be trusted.
**Reward**: 150 gp plus traveling expenses
**Combat**: Bandits who somehow know about the box, strange dreams while carrying it

### 6. [The Old Friend's Favor](hooks/06_old_friends_favor.md)
**Source**: Daran Edermath
**The Hook**: Daran's "old adventuring companion" sent a letter asking him to investigate strange sounds from Cragmaw Cave (now empty after the party cleared it). Daran's too old for such work.
**The Truth**: Githyanki scouts are using the abandoned cave as a temporary base while their delegation decides whether to approach
**Reward**: Daran's +1 shortsword from his adventuring days
**Combat**: Cautious githyanki scouts, traps they've set, lingering cave dangers

## The Wanderer's Problems

### 7. [The Refugee's Riddle](hooks/07_refugees_riddle.md)
**Source**: A desperate mother at the inn
**The Hook**: Her son joined a "traveling carnival" that promised to show him the world. She's received strange letters mentioning "the grandmother who remembers" and "practicing for the gathering."
**The Truth**: The boy joined the Roadhearts delegation. He's safe but committed to something bigger.
**Reward**: 50 gp (her life savings), information about other missing youth
**Combat**: Potential conflict with protective delegation members

### 8. [The Howling Diplomat](hooks/08_howling_diplomat.md)
**Source**: Sister Garaele (priestess of Tymora)
**The Hook**: Wolves have been seen near town acting strangely - not hunting, just watching. One was heard speaking. The shrine wants them investigated.
**The Truth**: Awakened wolf scouts for the Sparked Minds, evaluating if humanoids can be trusted
**Reward**: Healing potions, blessing of Tymora
**Combat**: Misunderstanding with awakened animals, natural predators drawn by the unusual activity

## Early Arriving Delegations (Subtle)

**Most Subtle Arrivals:**
1. **The Watchers** (Daran) - Already in place for decades
2. **Kobold scouts** - Mistaken for common pests
3. **Drow (underground)** - Only noticed through side effects
4. **Awakened animals** - Dismissed as tall tales
5. **Githyanki scouts** - Hiding, ashamed to show themselves

**Slightly More Obvious:**
6. **Dwarf prospectors** - Disguised as miners
7. **Human refugees** - Blending with normal travelers
8. **Elf scholars** - Could be mistaken for researchers

## Hook Connections

As the party investigates these seemingly unrelated events:
- They accumulate Truthstone fragments
- They meet delegation members without realizing it
- They build reputation with various groups
- Daran evaluates their trustworthiness
- The scale gradually becomes apparent

The revelation should come slowly:
- Level 5: Strange but unrelated events
- Level 6: Pattern emerges, maybe find first Truthstone
- Level 7: Understand something big is coming
- Level 8: Ready for the full Remembrance event

## Notes for DM

- Each hook can be expanded into 1-2 sessions
- Not all hooks need to be pursued
- Failed hooks have consequences (delegations arrive anyway, just less friendly)
- Success makes later negotiations easier
- Keep the true purpose hidden until at least 3-4 hooks are complete
